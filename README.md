- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Angel-Simba
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code in C#(Later I wanna learn Python, and JavaScript). After learning the basics and fundamentals of C# I started to learn how to use Unity along with it.
- I am hoping to create an ok game by March(my birthday) which is quite a bit away(written in early August). I want to learn about coding and game programming and see what this site has to offer.
- Hopefully, I am able to achieve my goal.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me... uhh idk if there is an IM feature implemented on this app then feel free to message me.
